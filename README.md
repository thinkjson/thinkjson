## About Me

I love APIs, coffee, and the
<a href="https://twitter.com/iamoxfordcomma">Oxford comma</a>. I
am a
<a href="http://andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html">full stack engineer</a>
working in
<a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>,
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>,
and <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. I have exceled in a number of roles in the
Software Development Lifecycle, but my passion
for
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">making things</a>
makes me thrive in the role of individual contributer. I have been
programming since
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">age eight</a>, and
have always enjoyed seeing ideas come to life in my programs. I
love to ship
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2014/06/02/what-does-one-mean-by-elegant-code/#4151f15f2ca8">elegant code</a>
that solves
<a href="https://signalvnoise.com/archives2/getting_real_forget_feature_requests.php">real problems</a>, and iterate based on
<a href="https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real">real feedback</a>
from customers. I want to write software that improves people's
lives, and which supports our abilities and enriches our
relationships outside of the virtual world.
